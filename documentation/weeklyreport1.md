This week I have decided on a project, familiarized myself with the course material as well as Git and Github. I did not have the time to start programming this week as I finally decided on the project late Friday night. My major problem this week was which topic I wanted to do for my project, I was debating between a pathfinding project which I am more familiar with or an expanded tic tac toe AI game which might have been more interesting but I would have to do a good deal of reading before starting. Next week I will need to create an rough outline of what I want the project to look and function like, review the Datastructures and Algorithims that I will need to implement, read up on other algorithms that may be usefull and start programming. I have put in around ten hours of work this week.
