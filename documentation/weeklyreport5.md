This week I spent most of my time trying to first finish implementing jump point search then improve the efficency of JPS and Dijkstra's algorithm. I am now at a point where I am mostly happy now with the implementations of the pathfinding algorithms, there are a few small things I could still improve on to increase the readability and decrease the amount of repeated code, but I finally got JPS to consistantly beat out A star in terms of efficency. I added JPS algorithm the the graphical user interface, now the shortest path found with JPS is displayed on the map with the all the jump points, the total distance and the runtime. This week I learned more about how to implement JPS and I read more up on how to implement the required datastructures i.e. list and priority queue. The largest problem I faced this week was trying to improve the efficency and accuracy of JPS, for the longest of times it was around 50% slower than A star and on certain maps could not find a path to the goal. Next week I will need Implement my own implementation of priority queue and a list datastructure, start the performance evaluation, polish up my code, add more elements to the graphical user interface and work on the documentation.


This week I spent around 12 hours on my project.
