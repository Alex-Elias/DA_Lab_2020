This week I have read about jump point search and Fringe search algorithms, I implemented A Star algorithm and got decently far into JPS algorithm. I learned how JPS and Fringe search algorithms work in theory and decided to use JPS for my project due to the faster run time and I was unsure how to implement the Fringe search Open list datastructue. The largest problems I ran into this week were related to finding good sources on JPS and Fringe search, I have been using a research paper on JPS as my source. I mostly understand the unique parts of JPS but I am unsure how to fully relate them to my project. I am confused about which data structure I should use, right now I am using a priority queue with the combinded weight and heuristic as the priority determinator as implemented in A Star, but I am not sure how to compare the weights of different paths if I even need to. I am behind so I have a lot to catch up on next week, I need to finish JPS, put some exta work into A Star because it seems slower than it should be, start implementing data structures, finish the tests for the classes and start working on the performance tests, and do the code reviews.


I put in around 16 hours this week although most of it was for JPS which I did not fully figure out.
