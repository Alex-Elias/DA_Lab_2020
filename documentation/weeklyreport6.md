This week I have Implemented priority queue and list from scratch, made performance testing for the algorithms and completed the code review. I now have all the algorithms and datastructrues implemented from scratch besides the queue for BFS algorithm, but I will most likely remove BFS because it is not really relevant to my project. This week I learned how to implement a priority queue and relearned mergesort for the performance tests. I am unsure how to create a good performance test, right now I have each algorithm run through three different mazes 100 times each back to back and then take the median time. Would this be a good enough test or should I have a different methodology for testing? Next week I will finish the documentation for my project, finish implementing all the elements I want on the graphical user interface, finish testing for my classes, create better Javadocs, create more classes to reduce the repeated code and fix my variable and method names.

I have spent 12 hours this week on this class
